        At its most basic, these are the five git commands to get started:

            git clone – copies an entire repo, while establishing a connection between a local and remote repo.

            git add – tells git to track one or more files.

            git commit – notes a change to the local repo.

            git push – sends changes to a remote repo.

            git pull – downloads freshest version of the repo (from a remote repository) into the local repo.
